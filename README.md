## FAQ

#### Why create a text editor?

It's easy sometimes to use the latest framework on the market, but I atleast get lost in it sometimes so I wanted to take the "low level" route this time.

#### do you feel it improved your c++ skills?

I do, building software on a real product challenges you to a great extent, finding solutions and solving bugs.
